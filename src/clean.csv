they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take

someone's gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  4 my dreams keep me awake at night

when we wake but the other 0 percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his

honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i

levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you

it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin'

disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung

gotta go almost at the  ha ha big bro it's for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again  part  produced by streetrunner  4 i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off,19.0,detroit hip hop,434.077,61,81.086,0.612,0.797,0.358

Eminem,Untouchable,Revival,2017-12-08,pt i   hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you won't loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist 'ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin' this starspangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build,47.0,detroit hip

livin' put a dick in your rear end that's why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now because everybody knows   skylar grey

Eminem,Groundhog Day,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe),2013-11-05,what is a nightmare the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare   i used to think i had bad luck but i wasn't superstitious 'til one day i grew suspicious when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons then we flew the coop to michigan to start anew but ditchin' missouri for michigan didn't work so we moved back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan someone put me out my misery i can't do this again mom please stick to a decision discipline last thing i wanna do is listen she's like lex luthor bitchin her rules are kryptonite so the walls i done lost my power to see through them bitches but i run into 'em runnin' through the kitchen pretendin' to be blind superman 'cause i had no supervision but i did have a super power though i could turn into invisible kid disappear out of sight like a true magician and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different music into the picture and it became my new religion  interlude i remember it clearly even today   move back to michigan again to live with my grandma nan always itchin' for somethin' to do was flippin' through the radio stations one day and discovered this dj who was mixin' i say it to this day if you ain't listened to the wizard you ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin' i'd zone out with my headphones all i remember doing's wishin' for shoes fuck them stupid pumas bitch it's all about them new edition troops you get them ll cool j coolin' system made that final manoeuvre to 8 mile and hoover and somehow i saw my future is in this that's how i knew my mission little boom box boomin' spittin' practicin' numerous writtens when i'd sit in my room

touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit never quit too persistent  interlude carved an underground empire   started a group of misfits proof had a proposition if we all band together there ain't no stoppin' this shit come up with aliases bipolar opposites and be ready to come off the top as sharp precision if you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin' they'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you and you forgot your written opportunity knocks once it ain't knockin' again it tried dingdong ditchin' shit i fuckin' got that bitch in a headlock cut off

rap game's god but the name's not james todd i'm just a wordsmith so let these words lift 'cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't workin' out each is more merciless than the first

fuckin' yawn so mow the fuckin' lawn your asses are blades of grass and i'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap the goat just ate eight acres an eighth of that was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper oh look my notebook looks smokecooked like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot charred debris floatin' like oakwood was burnin' return of the no

stocked that's why there's parental advising visine every time i drop eye drop so throw on the theme to alfred i'll channel him like the panama canal but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out bitch i still get the bag when i'm putting garbage out plus the potty mouth i'm not about to wash it out the filthiest so all this talk about i'm washed up how preposterous because if cleanliness is next to godliness it's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself and i'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun still on top the pile got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial quick to call you out on your bullshit don't make me give that crock a dial 'cause if i do it see you later alligator made it out the trailer then i made a vow to cater to no one so hate i've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account so here's some more shit for you to complain about i say the bars that never slack yeah but always get attacked yeah i think they're gunnin' for me it's startin' to feel like that like i'm marked 'cause when i rap it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit 'cause i have this target on my back ew yuck but if i ever doublecrossed my

have's like a giant getting squashed by ants if this is the test of time i'd pass with flying colors like i just tossed my crayons tossed my crayons small medium and large size cans sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands which is a small price for lysol wipes and if my palms brush across my pants i wash my hands  interlude shit hold on man motherfucker happy birthday to fuck shh quiet   i sit in silence in candlelit environments sipping wild irish while getting violent homicidal visions when i'm spitting like this but really i'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes which is really childish and silly but i'm really like this i'm giving nightmares to billie eilish i'm diddy's side bitch  interlude what the fuck hold on wait i'm diddy's side bitch oh i'm still east side bitch   so

bird what the fuck is love that's a dirty word make me fall in it there's not a girl on earth or any other planet that's a world of hurt and i won't buy a designer 'cause i don't pander panda but i'm back with so many knots i need a chiropractor damn and this the final chapter why 'cause i'm either frying after oh or they gon' give me the needle what like a vinyl scratcher dj yeah i'm a card like hallmark at walmart with a small cart buying wall art and y'all who claim to be dogs aren't no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf but y'all pickin' the wrong tree they call me dog because i'm barking bar king bark bark barking and i got a lot yeah like where cars park i'd describe it as bowling why ball hard ball's hard 'cause the gutter's where my mind is and when it's in this frame better split like the five and the ten 'cause without a second to spare i'm strikin' again and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens pins the cypher begins i'm talkin' smack like heroin the mic's a syringe it's like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin my mind is a recycling bin there's no place i never been but i never budge and i never bend you hyperextend on me this game's life it depends like adult diapers for men even when i'm rappin' less stellar it's sour grapes i still whine i'm the best seller cellar like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dre's booth and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route so you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you but if bars were semimac's i'd be the mad hatter 'cause i got so many caps and you don't have any straps nah so you'd be a fitted yeah so don't act like you fittin' to snap bitch i'll pee p on your head like a phillies hat haha no stoppin' me you're on a window shopping spree bitch you probably go broke at the dollar tree you never buy shit all you ever cop's a plea you're always punkin' out like halloween you rather opt to flee you need to stop it punk homie you're not a g act like you got the pump and you're gonna cock the heat or get the glock and dump bitch if you shot a tree you wouldn't pop the trunk yeah and i'm buddies with alfred we about to disembowel them gut 'em and scalp 'em yeah this is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome 'cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album so i'm choppin' 'em up

Eminem,The Kids,The Marshall Mathers LP,2000-05-23,and everyone should get along okay children quiet down quiet down children i'd like to duce our new substitute teacher for the day his name is mr shady children quiet down please brian don't throw that shut up mr shady will be your new substitute while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia he's got aids good luck mr shady   hi there little boys and girls fuck you today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's thirty and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you   see children drugs are bad come on and if you don't believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you don't believe him ask your mom that's right she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs that's right so you don't act like everyone else does uhhuh and there's really nothin' else to say sing along drugs are just bad mmkay   my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels ecstasyit's the worst drug in the world if someone ever offers it to you don't do it kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back so don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you   see children drugs are bad that's right and if you don't believe me ask your dad that's right and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs don't smoke crack so you don't act like everyone else does that's right and there's really nothin' else to say but umm drugs are just bad mmkay   and last but not least one of the most humongous problems among young people today is fungus it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em and sometimes you see things that aren't there like what like fat women in gstrings with orange hair mr shady what's a gstring it's yarn claire women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em huh and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms whoops did i say 'magic mushrooms' i meant fungus your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue how come 'cause it comes from a cow's dung gross see drugs are bad it's a common fact but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at oh but don't be me 'cause if you grow up and you go and od they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee and get a disguise and hide 'cause it'll be my fault so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 'cause i'm bad for you   see children drugs are bad uhhuh and if you don't believe me ask your dad put that down and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can ask she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time and she will so kids say
